# Contact Form Setup Guide - EmailJS Integration

5. Check your email inbox for the message

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Form Shows "Failed to send message" Error

**Cause**: Usually incorrect EmailJS configuration

**Solutions**:
1. **Check your credentials**: Verify Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key are correct
2. **Check template variables**: Ensure your template uses the exact variable names listed above
3. **Check email service**: Make sure your email service is properly connected and active
4. **Check browser console**: Look for specific error messages in the developer tools

### Email Not Received

**Cause**: Email delivery or template issues

**Solutions**:
1. **Check spam folder**: EmailJS emails might be filtered as spam initially
2. **Verify email service**: Ensure your connected email service is working
3. **Test template**: Use EmailJS dashboard's "Test" feature to verify your template
4. **Check rate limits**: Free tier has 200 emails/day limit

### "Service ID not found" Error

**Cause**: Incorrect or inactive Service ID

**Solutions**:
1. **Double-check Service ID**: Copy it exactly from your EmailJS dashboard
2. **Verify service status**: Ensure your email service is active and properly configured
3. **Re-authenticate**: Try disconnecting and reconnecting your email service

### CORS or Network Errors

**Cause**: Domain restrictions or network issues

**Solutions**:
1. **Check domain whitelist**: In EmailJS settings, ensure your domain is allowed
2. **Use HTTPS**: EmailJS works better with HTTPS in production
3. **Check firewall**: Ensure EmailJS domains aren't blocked
